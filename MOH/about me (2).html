        <h1>My Biography</h1>
        <p>My name is Yasmin Mohammed. I was born at Hewan Clinic on Monday, May 5, 2008, at around 10:00 AM. I am the only daughter and the third child in my family. I have two older brothers and one younger brother. I started daycare at six months old because my mother worked, which is why I began school at a young age.</p>
        
        <h1>My Skills and Hobbies</h1>
        <p>One of my key skills is cooking, thanks to my mother, who is a cook and taught me how to prepare meals. I am also a swimmer. My parents made sure my brothers and I learned how to swim from a young age, and now we can all swim confidently. Additionally, I know how to crochet, a skill I learned from my grandmother and childhood friend. As for my hobbies, I enjoy reading books, and I also consider cooking and swimming as hobbies.</p>
        
        <h1>My Educational Background</h1>
        <p>Currently, I am studying at the School of Aygoda. Before that, I attended Melkam Ejoch and Bright Future. I was at Melkam Ejoch from daycare to KG-3, but since the school did not have an elementary section, I moved to Bright Future School, where I studied from grade 1 to grade 8. Now, I have been at the School of Aygoda since grade 9.</p>
        
        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>I have completed several group and individual assignments. Additionally, I have participated in science fair projects for the past two years.</p>
        
        <h1>My Certificates</h1>
        <p>I have received three certificates: one this year and two last year. The first was for ranking third in my class, the second was for participating in a science fair project, and the third was again for ranking third. These certificates are just the beginning; I believe there are many more achievements to come.</p>
